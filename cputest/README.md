# 65C816 test ROM

This is an SNES ROM that performs comprehensive testing of the 65C816 instruction set.

If a test fails, see the autogenerated tests.txt or tests.inc files for details about the test.

### The ROM tests the following:

- All 65C816 opcodes except STP and WAI
- Each instruction is tested in all supported addressing modes
- Multiple tests per instruction, designed to test edge cases and correct flag result
- Wrapping behavior of various addressing modes for all instructions, with and without emulation mode

### The ROM does *not* test:

- Cycle count taken by instructions, or other timing-related behavior
- Hardware interrupts
- memory-mapped registers

## Building:

The required tools are ca65/ld65 and Python 3.

Either use the Makefile by running `make`, or run:

    python3 make_cpu_tests.py
    ca65 main.asm -o cputest.o
    ld65 -C lorom.cfg -o cputest.sfc cputest.o
